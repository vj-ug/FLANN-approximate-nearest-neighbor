# FLANN-approximate-nearest-neighbor
Feature matching in image with approximate nearest neighbor

C++ and Python.

-- Finally pushed from Private to Public.   More advance implementations will be pushed soon.


- FLANN is Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors. 
- Optimized for fast nearest neighbor search for high dimensional features in a large dataset
- More efficient than BFMatcher

Written in optimized C/C++, the library can take advantage of multi-core processing.
